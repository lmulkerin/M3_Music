**Relax and Recurse**

# Description:
This repo contains a Sonic Pi file containing background music for an educational song about recursion. This song is intended to follow a typical intro to computer science curriculum and help students study for an exam. While composing, I wanted the song to sort of resemble a circus feeling, because I thought it would bring a stress-free lightheartedness to student studying while embodying just a bit of the chaos of this time of year. The simple rhythms, key, repetition of note progressions, and overall song organization are an attempt at this feeling.


# Song lyrics:
Call the function, pass it in,  
Watch the cycle soon begin.  
Break down a problem into clones,  
Solve the small, then return home.  
🎶  
Every step a smaller call,  
Shrinking problems, one and all.  
🎶  
Reeeeeeeeecuuuursion  
It’s calling itself and then,  
A spiral down, back to where it’s been.  
Reeeeeeeeecuuuursion  
When the base case stops the fall,  
We return, to answer the call.  
🎶  
Choose a base case but be wise  
For a bad one is demise.  
Pick the final result there,  
And you should not despair.  
🎶  
Reeeeeeeeecuuuursion  
It’s calling itself and then,  
A spiral down, back to where it’s been.  
Reeeeeeeeecuuuursion  
When the base case stops the fall,  
We return, to answer the call.  
🎶  
Call the function, watch it run  
Recursion ends where it’s begun.  
🎶  
[final instrumental music]
